# GitBook books living in GitHub

This document is a part of Aurelia-Tools internal documentation library.It describes the **process of its own creation** using only the browser to do it.

### 1. Create a new book 

Point your browser to our GitBook main page:  https://www.gitbook.com/@aurelia-ui-toolkits and click on the **`+ NEW`** button (Image 1, below)

This should result with the **`Create a new book`** dialog: (Image 2 below). Define your choices in the order suggested by red markers.

I also deleted the "Chapter 1" page that is a part of the template selected with the click on item tagged with red marker 1 on the Image 2 above. For this document, a single page is sufficient.

Now, our book is created and can be accessed via URL https://aurelia-ui-toolkits.gitbooks.io/gitbooks-living-in-github/content/ and as the URL suggests, it is persisted on the **`gitbooks.io`** server - certainly not in GitHub.

### 2 Transfer the book to GitHub
